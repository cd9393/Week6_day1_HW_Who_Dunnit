Scenario 1
Murderer is miss scarlett because the constant is defined on the "top level" so the function can view that information.

Scenario 2
error because you are trying to change a constant.

Scenario 3
First verdict will be Mrs Peackcock and then second verdict will be Professor plum. Because the "let" inside the function declare murderer will only be accessible to that function.

Scenario 4
The suspects are Miss Scarlett, Professor Plum and Colonel Mustard,
The third suspect is Mrs Peacock.
the first instance is assigning a variable to the function declare all and within this function suspect 3 is altered to colonel mustard. However as it is a let value within the function it does not change the value of suspect 3 outside of the function.

Scenario 5
Revolver because the values within a hash which has been assigned as a constant can still be altered.

Scenario 6
error? --- After Running it -- Mrs white because the function is a constant not the murderer value so it should be free to change? variable is a global variable within the function.

Scenario 7
Miss Scarlett. --After running-- MR Green not sure why? Possibly because "Global" variable can only be accessed from 1 level above? so the unexpectedOutcome wouldnt change the value and the plot twist is a let value so is only altering murderer within it's function.

Scenario 8
Lead-Pipe -- after running -- CandleStick - don't understand why? function is run before the function which changes the murderer to colonel mustard so first outcome shouldnt change the weapon.....

Scenario 9
Professor Plum? not so sure if being within an if statement means the let is only valid for that if statement similar to a function? -- after running Professor Plum but not 100% why.
